# Deep Learning Statistical Arbitrage

## Overview: End-to-End ML/DL Based Trade Strategy Development

This project offers a comprehensive framework for the development and deployment of machine learning and deep learning models in trading strategies. Beginning with raw stock OHLCV data, the pipeline extends through data preprocessing, research, model training, and ultimately to live trading. The aim is to provide a full spectrum view of trading model development, inclusive of various skills and tools employed at different stages.

## Skills Demonstrated

### Data Preprocessing

The project commences with an efficient preprocessing of raw stock data, implemented in the notebook `01_raw_data_to_create_dataset.ipynb`. This stage is designed for handling large datasets, optimized to provide clean data for subsequent steps.

### Research and Dataset Building

Research-oriented notebooks focus on sample selection and factor research. They are covered in notebooks `02_sample_selection_and_returns_calculation.ipynb` and `03_common_alpha_factors.ipynb`. An additional notebook, `04_101_formulaic_alphas.ipynb`, explores a variety of alpha factors.

### ML/DL Model Development

Machine Learning and Deep Learning models are then trained and tested. Experiments are managed via MLflow for transparency and reproducibility. Relevant notebooks include `06_a_ML_models_forecasting.ipynb`, `06_b_DL_models_forecasting.ipynb`, and `06_c_DL_models_generative.ipynb`.

### Strategy Building and Backtesting

In the `07_strategy_building_and_backtesting.ipynb` notebook, a momentum-based trading strategy is devised employing traditional quantitative methods and modern portfolio optimization. The approach integrates machine learning predictions, dynamic portfolio rebalancing, and robust risk management techniques, including VaR computation and stop-loss mechanisms. This holistic strategy underscores the seamless fusion of ML insights with trading tactics.

### Operational Tools

The project is supported by a series of scripts and utilities. These range from dataset management (`top_stock_dataset_pipeline.py`) to MLflow experiment tracking (`top_mlflow_experiment.py`). Operational aspects are further enhanced by scripts for Git and Docker automation (`auto_commit.sh`, `push_to_dockerhub.sh`).

## Project Objective

The overarching objective is to offer a robust, end-to-end example of machine learning and deep learning in trading. It is intended to serve as a display of various skills: from data management and feature engineering to model development and deployment. These skills are supplemented by proficiency in various development tools, such as Git, Docker, and Bash, among others.
